# Pre-Assignment Question & Answer

1. What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- I think that the most important risk here is the knowledge of the API and the graph because I think that the way to parse the data in weeks can cause problems from my side.

2. What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- To be honest my unique change that I did is the option to get the repo list when the user clicks enter because in this way we just have a request when the user wants.

3. List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

    1. Change the enter submit to get the request from the API
    2. Add some heading to the chart.

4. Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions.

- I am ok.
